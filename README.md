# The-Best-Intern
I am on a quest to obtain the freest and freshest juice from the mythical crimson cow by proving to the mighty Humans of Resources (HR) that I am indeed the Best Intern of All Time and general Cool Human (BIATCH). Normally, one needs friends to accomplish such a dangerous task. While I initially did not have nearly enough friends to obtain the juice, I took matters into my own hands and made some friends. Many of them. Like several thousand at least. 

## How to run
Normally, I would put something on how to run this project, but this really is just for me. I'm not quite sure why I am even uploading it to Github. Perhaps I will stumble upon this repo in the far future and have a good chuckle at this readme, and a good wince at the actual code. Future me will hopefully be reading this sipping on the cool juice from the crimson cow.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the Faker library for generating fake names and email addresses, as well as selenium for interacting with the intern page.
